# PRODIGY_DS_02
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which provides information about passengers onboard the Titanic, including demographics and survival status.
## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This dataset is widely used as a beginner's dataset in data science to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The goal of this project is to perform EDA to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains demographic information and passenger survival data for 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew aboard the Titanic. It includes details such as:

1. Passenger Class (Pclass)
2. Name
3. Sex
4. Age
5. Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
6. Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
7. Ticket Number
8. Fare
9. Cabin
10. Port of Embarkation (Embarked)
11. Survival Status (Survived)


## Installation
To run the analysis scripts, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/titanic-analysis.git
cd titanic-analysis

#### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

#### 3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Activate the virtual environment (if used).
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to perform EDA on the Titanic dataset.
